# Flux Controller

## Overview
Flux Controller is a simple flux control tool to help people avoid others in the street during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It uses a flow network to model the streets and the people using them, and then applies max-flow algorithms (Edmonds-Karp in p2_ek.c and push-relabel in p2.c) to get the most optimal solution.

A more thorough overview can be found on *report.pdf*.


## Running Flux Controller
Interaction with Flux Controller happens through a terminal. The compilation and use specifics can be found on the assignment details (check *assignment.pdf* - in Portuguese), along with more information.
