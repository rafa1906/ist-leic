# Event Manager

## Overview
Event Manager is a very simple system for **scheduling and managing events**. It is **terminal-based** (expanded upon further below).

The program enables the user to store relevant event data -- **room/location**, **organizer**, **start time**, etc. This specific version allows for **up to 10 rooms** and **up to 100 events per room**.


## Running Event Manager
As was briefly mentioned in the **Overview** section, interaction with Event Manager happens through a terminal. The program can be compiled using *gcc* and then run in a standard command line. Event Manager commands will look something like:

```console
a Space Heist:29032019:1000:60:1:Rick:Morty:Summer:Beth
```

Where the first character determines the requested action and the rest of the command holds the necessary data (dependent on command).

A detailed overview of possible actions and input format can be found in *assignment.md* (in portuguese).


## Academic details

The final grade was **20.00/20.00**.
