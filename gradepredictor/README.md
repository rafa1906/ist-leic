# Grade Predictor

## Overview
Grade Predictor is a simple note prediction tool which uses a "friend" system to detect students who might share solutions.

It uses a graph to model friendships and a simple propagation algorithm to update the grades of reachable nodes.

A more thorough overview can be found on *report.pdf*.


## Running Grade Predictor
Interaction with Grade Predictor happens through a terminal. The compilation and use specifics can be found on the assignment details (check *assignment.pdf* - in Portuguese), along with more information. An alternative is using runTests.sh, which compiles the code and runs a set of tests:

```console
./runTests.sh
```


## Academic details
This project was developed for ASA (Análise e Síntese de Algoritmos) - a second year programming class about more intermediate and advanced algorithms.

It was done with the help of @barbosa46 (https://github.com/barbosa46).

The final grade was **19.30/20.00**.
